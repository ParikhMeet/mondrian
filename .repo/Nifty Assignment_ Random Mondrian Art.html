  using a recursive algorithm.

    <tbody><tr><td>Summary</td>
        <td>
          The Random Mondrian Art assignment has students create pseudo-random
          "art".  While the provided algorithm produces basic art in a 
          Mondrian style, the possibilities to extend the assignment and
          generate much more interesting art are nearly endless.
        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Audience</td>
        <td>
          I have used this assignment as the first assessment in a third-year
          programming language paradigms course that introduces students
          to functional programming for the first time.  I also believe that
          it would work well as a recursion assignment toward the end of CS1,
          but I haven't yet had an opportunity to use it in that context.
        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Difficulty</td>
        <td>
          Students found this assignment to be moderately difficult, at least
          in part because it was the first program of significant length that
          they were ever asked to create on their own using Haskell.  I give
          the students approximately 2 weeks to complete the assignment, both
          so that they have time to resolve problems they are experiencing
          because they are new to functional programming, and so they have time
          to experiment with the open-ended portion of the assignment.  
          Similarly, I'd give students about 2 weeks to complete this
          assignment near the end of CS1.

    <tr><td>Topics</td>
        <td>
          Recursion.  When implemented in Haskell, lists are also used
          to manage the random numbers without requiring monads.  Lists / 
          arrays are not necessary when implementing in Java or Python.
        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Strengths</td>
        <td>
          The assignment provides nearly unlimited opportunity to express
          one's artistic style while also being an example of a problem that
          is easier to solve recursively than iteratively.  The artistic
          aspect of the assignment encourages students to spend time 
          coding, and to experiment with different strategies for generating
          the shapes and colors.  The amount of variation in the submitted
          assignments is very large, suggesting that students were either
          interested in the assignment or very motivated by the small 
          grade boost associated with implementing an extension to the 
          provided algorithm.
        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Weaknesses</td>
        <td>
          In Haskell, generating a list of random numbers before calling the
          student created function to avoid using Monads is a little bit
          stilted, but it works (and based on the order in which I teach the
          course material has the beneficial side effect of forcing students to
          practice working with lists in addition to recursion).  
          <p>
          The first time I used this assignment I had some cases where it
          was difficult to determine if the code the student submitted
          deviated from the provided algorithm due to inability to
          implement it, or for artistic reasons.  The revised handout has
          (hopefully) addressed this by requiring students to implement the
          provided algorithm before modifying it to match their own
          artistic style.
          </p><p>
          The grading can be a little bit subjective when it comes to
          determining whether or not the enhancements implemented by students
          represent no extension, a modest extension or a substantial 
          extension.  As a result, I had more requests to override TA 
          grading than I typically do.  Despite this, I think that it is
          important to attach a small number of marks to the enhancements
          to encourage students to spent more time experimenting.
        </p></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Dependencies</td>
        <td>
          In Haskell, we had the students generate HTML output to avoid
          being dependent on a particular graphics library as we are not
          aware of a good platform independent option for Haskell.  A Java 
          or Python implementation could display the output using any graphics
          library, or like the Haskell version, could output an HTML document
          that can be viewed in any modern browser.
        </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Variants</td>
        <td>
          We left coming up with variants to the students (and motivated them
          to do so with a small number of marks).  They didn't disappoint, as 
          shown at the end of this document.
